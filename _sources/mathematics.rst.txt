Mathematical problem solving with SymPy
=======================================

Knowing the basics of SymPy, let's now solve several mathematical problems
with it. The level of difficulty of examples in this section varies from
simple symbolic manipulation to theorem proving in algebraic geometry.
Each section includes a short theoretical background, that introduces
mathematics needed to understand a particular example. Code examples and
size of problems were adjusted to make them unobtrusive to tutorial
readers and make it possible to run them even on mobile devices.
