Introduction to SymPy
=====================

SymPy (http://www.sympy.org) is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics.
It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the
code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.
SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.

We will start the presentation of SymPy by showing how to install and setup it.
Then we will proceed with the basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical
expressions in SymPy. We will also discuss the most common problems with SymPy and
differences between it and mathematical systems, and how to deal with them. At the
end we will discuss SymPy's capabilities of printing expressions and show how to
modify existing printers and implement new ones.
